      SUBROUTINE ARY1_RETYP( PAREN, NAME, TYPE, STATE, BAD, NDIM, DIM,
     :                       NTYPE, DEFER, LOC, DCE, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     ARY1_RETYP

*  Purpose:
*     Change the data type of a primitive numeric HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL ARY1_RETYP( PAREN, NAME, TYPE, STATE, BAD, NDIM, DIM, NTYPE,
*                      DEFER, LOC, DCE, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine changes the data type of a primitive numeric HDS
*     object while (optionally) preserving its contents. If the
*     contents are to be preserved, then data type conversion will be
*     performed on them.

*  Arguments:
*     PAREN = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        HDS locator to the object's parent structure.
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        HDS name of the object whose type is to be changed.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Initial data type of the HDS object. This must be a primitive
*        numeric HDS data type string (case insensitive).
*     STATE = LOGICAL (Given)
*        The HDS state of the data object (.TRUE. for defined, .FALSE.
*        for undefined). This argument determines whether the contents
*        of the object are to be preserved. They are only preserved if
*        its value is .TRUE..
*     BAD = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Whether checks for "bad" data values must be made if data type
*        conversion is performed. This argument is not used if STATE is
*        set to .FALSE..
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of object dimensions.
*     DIM( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Object dimension sizes.
*     NTYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        The new data type required for the object. This must be a
*        primitive numeric HDS data type string (case insensitive).
*     DEFER = LOGICAL (Given)
*        Should creation of the new HDS arrays be deferred?
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        HDS locator to the object whose type is to be changed. Note
*        that type conversion involves erasing the object and creating
*        a new version, so this locator will be altered if the new type
*        differs from the initial one.
*     DCE = LOGICAL (Returned)
*        Whether data conversion errors occurred. This can only happen
*        if STATE is set to .TRUE..
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The routine will execute most rapidly if STATE is set to
*     .FALSE., since no data values then need to be converted.

*  Algorithm:
*     -  Initialise the DCE value and check if the new type matches the
*     the old type. If so, then the data object's type does not need
*     changing. Ensure that it is in the expected state by resetting it
*     if appropriate.
*     -  If the object's data type needs changing, but STATE is
*     .FALSE., then erase the original object and create a new one of
*     the required type. Obtain a locator to it.
*     -  If STATE is .TRUE., then create a temporary structure and move
*     the original data object into it.
*     -  Create a new data object of the required type and obtain a
*     locator to it.
*     -  Map both the old and new objects.
*     -  Calculate the number of data values that need converting.
*     -  Compare the new data type with each permitted value in turn and
*     call the appropriate routine to convert the old data into the new
*     type.
*     -  Unmap the new data object.
*     -  Annul the locator to the old data and erase the temporary
*     structure containing it.

*  Implementation Deficiencies:
*     -  This routine requires a parent locator in order to function, so
*     it cannot be used on a top-level HDS object.

*     2-AUG-1989 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     31-AUG-1989 (RFWS):
*        Changed to ensure that the data object is set to the expected
*        state (defined or undefined) even if its data type does not
*        need alteration.
*     18-JUL-2006 (DSB):
*        Add DEFER argument.
*     2012-05-07 (TIMJ):
*        Add _INT64 support.
*     4-NOV-2014 (DSB):
*        If the type need not be changed, do not reset the data object if 
*        array creation has been deferred.
