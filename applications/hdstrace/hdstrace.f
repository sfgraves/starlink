      SUBROUTINE HDSTRACE( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     HDSTRACE

*  Purpose:
*     Examines the contents of a data-system object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL HDSTRACE( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     Data files in ADAM are stored in an hierarchical format (HDS).
*     This cannot be read by just typing the file at the terminal or
*     spooling it to a printer---a special application is required.
*     Now rather than writing separate code to read a variety of
*     structures, this application is sufficiently general to examine
*     almost all HDS structures or objects.  The examination may also
*     be written to a text file as well as being reported to the user.
*
*     For the specified ADAM data-system object (X) there are three
*     cases which are handled:
*
*     1) X is a primitive object. The value, or the first and last few
*        values of X are listed.
*
*     2) X is a structure.  The contents of the structure are
*        listed. If a component is encountered which is itself a
*        structure then its contents are listed down to a level of six
*        nested structures.
*
*     3) X is an array of structures.  All elements will be listed
*        if Parameter FULL is set to TRUE; only the first element will
*        be listed when Parameter FULL is set to FALSE (default).
*        Arrays of structures nested six deep can be listed.
*
*     Listings are in the following order: name; dimensions, if any;
*     type; and value or comment.  Comments are enclosed in braces.
*
*     The values are normally listed at the end of each line, but may
*     start on a new line.  The maximum number of lines of data values
*     may also be set.  For all but the smallest arrays where the values
*     of all elements can be displayed in the space provided, the last
*     few values in the array as well as the first few are presented.
*     The last few values appear on a new line, indented the same as
*     the line above with the ellipsis notation to indicate any missing
*     values.  Note the number of elements shown depends on the number
*     of characters that will fit on the line.  The ellipsis notation
*     is also used for long character values where there is only room
*     to show the first and last few characters.  Bad values appear as
*     asterisks.
*
*     The exact layout may be adjusted and is controlled by four
*     additional parameters: a) the indentation of the type string with
*     respect to the beginning of the name string; b) indentation of the
*     value(s) (if not on a new line) with respect to the beginning of
*     the type string; and c) the width of the output.  If the name
*     and dimensions do not fit within the space given by parameters
*     a) and b), the alignment will be lost because at least two spaces
*     will separate the name from the type, or the type from the
*     value(s).  The fourth parameter defines how character arrays are
*     arranged.  The default is that character-array elements are
*     concatenated to fill the available space delimited by commas.  The
*     alternative is to write the value of each element on a new line.
*     This improves readability for long strings.

*  Usage:
*     hdstrace object [full] [nlines] [typind] [valind] [logfile]
*        [eachline] [newline] [width] [widepage]

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     EACHLINE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true the elements of a character array will each appear on
*        a separate line.  Otherwise elements fill the available space
*        and may span several lines, paragraph style. [FALSE]
*     FULL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true, all the contents of an array of structures will be
*        traced, otherwise only the first element is examined. [FALSE]
*     LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read)
*        The name of the ASCII file to contain a log of the examination
*        of the data object.  Null (!) means do not create a log file.
*        [!]
*     NEWLINE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        True indicates that data values are to start on a new line
*        below the name and type, and indented from the name.
*        Otherwise the values are appended to the same line. [FALSE]
*     NLINES = LITERAL (Read)
*        The maximum number of lines in which data values of each
*        primitive array component may be displayed, but excluding the
*        continuation line used to show the last few values.  Note that
*        there may be several data values per line.  There is no
*        formatting of the values.  If you require the whole of each
*        array use NLINES = "ALL".  Beware this facility can result in
*        a large report, so select just the array or arrays you wish to
*        trace. [1]
*     OBJECT = UNIV (Read)
*        The name of the data-system object to be traced.  This may be
*        a whole structure if the name of the container file is given,
*        or it may be an object within the container file, or even a
*        sub-section of an array component.
*     TYPIND = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Column indentation of the component's type with respect to
*        the current indentation of the component's name.  If the name
*        plus dimensions cannot fit in the space provided alignment
*        will be lost, since HDSTRACE insists that there be a gap of at
*        least two columns.  Note that HDS names can be up to 15
*        characters, and the dimension in the format (dim1,dim2,...) is
*        abutted to the name. [15]
*     VALIND = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Column indentation of the component's value(s) with respect to
*        the current indentation of the component's type provided
*        NEWLINE is false.  If, however, NEWLINE is true, VALIND is
*        ignored and the value is indented by one column with respect
*        to the component's name.  If the type cannot fit in the space
*        provided alignment will be lost, since HDSTRACE insists that
*        there be a gap of at least two columns.  HDS types can be up
*        to 15 characters. [15]
*     WIDEPAGE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If true a 132-character-wide format is used to report the
*        examination.  Otherwise the format is 80 characters wide.
*        It is only accessed if WIDTH is null.  [FALSE]
*     WIDTH = _INTEGER (Read)
*        Maximum width of the the output in characters.  The default is
*        the screen width of a terminal and 80 for a file.  []

*  Notes:
*     This application allows far more flexibility in layout than
*     earlier applications like LS and the original TRACE, though the
*     order of the attributes of an object has been fixed and
*     rearranged for standardisation, particularly for documentation
*     purposes.

*  Algorithm:
*     Get a locator to the HDS object
*     If no error then
*        Get the full-trace switch, the new-line switch, the number of
*          lines of values, the default indentation for type and value
*        If no error then
*           Get the necessary information for the HDS object.
*           Put out the HDSTRACE header message.
*           Deal with the HDS object depending on whether it is of
*             PRIMITIVE type, a STRUCTURE or an ARRAY of STRUCTURES.
*           If object is of primitive type then put out the information
*             and values associated with this PRIMITIVE HDS object.
*           Else
*              If object is an ARRAY of STRUCTURES, report its name and
*                 dimensions.
*              Examine the HDS object tracing down the array of
*                structures recursively.
*           Endif
*        Endif
*        Put out the HDSTRACE termination message.
*        Tidy up the HDS object.
*     Endif

*  History:
*     1989 May 16 (MJC):
*        Converted from Baines's TRACE.
*     1989 Jun 15 (MJC):
*        Extra options added for file output, width of the page and one
*        character-array element per line; revise subroutine calls to
*        use TRA_ library.
*     1991 January 31 (MJC):
*        Converted to the SST prologue and expanded the parameter
*        descriptions.
*     1992 January 13 (MJC):
*        Documented the flagging of bad pixels.  Now applies to all
*        numeric data types.
*     1992 September 24 (MJC):
*        Called a new recursive routine that has virtually unlimited
*        ability to trace through the object, and prevents multiple
*        blank lines.  This routine terminates the output with a blank
*        line, so have done likewise for a primitive object, and removed
*        the blank line before the "End of Trace" message.
*     1992 September 25 (MJC):
*        Removed AIF calls.
*     1993 November 4 (MJC):
*        Renamed to HDSTRACE from TRACE to avoid a name clash on UNIX
*        systems.
*     2014 November 15 (MJC):
*        Added WIDTH parameter to allow more control over the width,
*        which defaults to the terminal width.  Adjust the
*        message-system output size to match.  Only access WIDEPAGE if
*        WIDTH is undefined.  WIDEPAGE is retained only for backwards
*        compatibility.
